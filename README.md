## RECOMMENDATION

As much as there are other factors that could affect the profitability of any given film, the profit from each genre as well as the ratings seams to affect the industry most.
The high rating indicates that the film will stay on demand for long thus continue earning from the film for a long duration of time.
I would recommend to start by  adventure genre since it has the highest average profitability in relation to both total gross and average rating.
